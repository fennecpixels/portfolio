*fennecpixels*, the pseudonym of Rose Crowne, embraces imperfection and learning in their art and worldbuilding projects. Identity features prominently in their works: when labels are insufficient, how else can you define yourself? Pictures painted by a milllion tangents - with no better example than their prodigal world *Fracture*, a world constantly in flux, corresponding to their own personal growth, now centred around the role of Language in identity and daily life. Their newest project, codenamed *Maritime*, is a nostalgic eulogy about their relationship to their childhood countryside.  As ever, their work as a painter, writer, and very amateur musician embraces traditional technique on a digital canvas - what can you make when you try?
